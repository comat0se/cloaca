"""A client user interface for a player in gtr.
This is to be used by a networked client as the connection to the user.
The interface is expected to be entirely on the command line with 
output via stdout in a terminal window. However, the interface presented
is a set of action_* methods that are called when a particular GameAction
is needed. The Client object creates an ActionBuilder object (eg.
LaborerActionBuilder) that may contain internal states on the way to building
up a GameAction. 

For example, the LaborerActionBuilder needs to get 2 inputs from the player:
the card to take from the pool and the card to take from the players hand
if they have a Dock. The class has an internal state machine that stores
which of the choices have been made. Each user input causes a transition to
a new state. Specifically, the sequence is 
START->FROM_POOL->FROM_HAND->FINISHED
The transition to the FINISHED state sets the LaborerActionBuilder.done
flag and the action member to a GameAction representing the Laborer action.
The network interface sends this action to the server.

The ActionBuilder classes use lists of Choice objects to represent user
choices. These are simply containers for an item to be selected, a 
description of that item, and a flag to indicate whether it's selectable.
Unselectable choices exists so that a list can be displayed with certain
items "grayed out".

The RoleActionBuilder class is used for both the follow role action and
the lead role action because so much of the Palace and Petition code is
shared.

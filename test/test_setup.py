    Optionally allowed to specify clients and buildings for each player. The
    clientele argument is an iterable of iterables, where the primary index is
    the players in order 1, 2 and each element is a list of clients that player
    should have. Likewise with the buildings argument. The buildings should be
    just the name of the foundations and will be completed with more copies of
    that foundation. For example:

        # Leg. and arch. client for p1, craftsman for p2.

    Adding clientele must be done before resolving the lead role action so they
    are counted. Adding buildings usually can be done in the individual test
    cases if they add static effects (eg. Archway), but the Fountain or Circus
    Maximus need to be done before the lead role action. This is also more
    convenient if you just want a static building ability active.

class GTRServer(object):
    """Manages multiple Game objects including non-game actions related to
    connecting players and starting games.

    The send_command(user, command) method must be assigned to an appropriate
    handle when this object is created.

    GTRServer doesn't handle any user authentication. It assumes
    the <user> parameter to any GameAction commands is uniquely
    defined and trusts the arguments to handle_command.

    Basic usage: Start a server, request the (empty) game list, create
    a new game which is assigned game_id=0. Request starting the game,
    which results in the game state being transmitted to all players.
    Submit a ThinkerOrLead action that again results in the new game
    state being sent to all players.

        uid = get_uid('p1')

        s = GTRServer()
        s.register_user(uid, {'name': 'p1'})

        s.send_command = lambda u, c: print 'User:', u, 'Command:', c
        s.handle_command(uid, Command(None, GameAction(REQGAMELIST)))
        # prints 'User: <uid> Command(None, GAMELIST, <list>)'
        
        s.handle_command(<uid>, Command(None, GameAction(REQCREATEGAME)))
        # prints 'User: <uid> Command(0, JOINGAME)'
        
        s.handle_command(<uid>, Command(0, GameAction(REQSTARTGAME)))
        # prints 'User: <uid> Command(0, STARTGAME)'
        # prints 'User: <uid> Command(0, GAMESTATE, <game_state>)'
        
        s.handle_command(<uid>, Command(0, GameAction(THINKERORLEAD, [True])))

        ...


    Command responses

    Each command is listed here with a description of parameters and the
    reponse expected from the server. All commands are passed with a user id
    (uid) in the handle_command() function. The Command objects have a game ID
    parameter, but this is not always required.

    REQGAMELIST: Get the list of GameRecord objects
        No parameters, game ID not required

        Response:
        GAMELIST: The list of GameRecord objects is send to the client as a
        list of JSON objects with the format:
            {'game_id': <id>,
             'players': <player_list>,
             'started': <started>,
             'host' : <host_uid>}

        Errors
        None


    REQGAMESTATE: Get the game state dict for a specified game ID.
        No parameters, game ID required

        Response
        GAMESTATE: The GameState object is serialized to JSON using each
        object's __dict__. Thus, an object Card(ident=20) is
        represented as {'ident': 20}.

        Errors
        Game ID isn't a valid game.


    REQCREATEGAME: Create a new game with unspecified game ID.
        No Parameters, game ID not required

        Response
        JOINGAME: The game id is sent to confirm that the user joined the
        nely-created game.

        Errors
        None


    REQJOINGAME: Join a game with the game ID.
        No Parameters, game ID required

        Response
        JOINGAME: The game id is sent to confirm that the user joined the
        existing game.
        GAMESTATE: The GameState of the joined game. See REQGAMESTATE.

        Errors
        Game is full.
        Game is already started.
        You have already joined this game.


    REQSTARTGAME: Start a game.
        No Parameters, game ID required

        Repsonse
        STARTGAME: Confirm that the game has started.
        GAMESTATE: GameState object of the started game. See REQGAMESTATE.

        Errors
        You are not the host of the game.
        Game is already started.


    [GameAction]: Any other commands are considered GameAction commands.
            These are passed to the specified game to handle.
        GameAction parameters, game ID required

        Response
        GAMESTATE: If the action is successfully handled, an updated
            GameState is sent to all players.

        Errors
        You aren't playing in this game.
        This game is not started.
        This game has already finished.
        You don't have priority in this game.
        The action is invalid.
        The action is not the expected action for this game.
        There was a GameRulesError while processing the action.

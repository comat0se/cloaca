""" Controls the game state and directs the game.

Handles the basic loop of gameplay - asking for input from the active
player, evaluating the legality of the requested actions, and
manipulating the game state to take that action.
"""

# A state machine - each node is the next spot that the server
# needs input from the client. 
#
# An action stack - in game states, we can stack up actions
# via game rules or special abilities of buildings.
# In particular, since everything happens immediately, actions need
# to be able to handle having other actions triggered within their
# resolution.
#
# A horrible example of this is finishing a Garden with a Bath
# and a Bar in play. The Garden allows many patron actions.
# During each patron action, a client is selected from the pool
# and then it performs its action, potentially completing other
# buildings. After this, the Bar allows another patron to
# enter the clientele, again potentially completing buildings.
#
# In light of this, it's not really an action stack where an action is popped
# off as it resolves. Each action
# is a function, which calls other actions within it. A better 
# description might be an action stack frame. After each action is
# resolved, we back out to the previous frame.
#
# Some reasons not to use the Python stack inspection and instead implement
# our own stack mangement:
#   - Make the path easier to track. The viewer will want to know what's
#     going on.
#
# How to use two actions to start a building.
# Since this can only be done when there are literally two craftsmen in a row
# or two archtects in a row, we need to be able to accept them as a group.
# Here's when we can get multiple actions to start an out-of-town site:
#   - clientele following lead
#   - clientele doubling via Circus Maximus
#   - two clientele of same role
#   - craftsman actions from Amphitheater
#   - multiple lead/follow via Palace
#   - (ambiguous in the rules?) 1 remaining on the Amphitheater, but also a client.
#     Even with clever rearranging, you might not be allowed to start two OOT sites
#     with an Amphitheater for 3 and a followup craftsman client.
#
# In any case, it's hard to process the craftsmen one at a time.
#
# Out-of-town site Option A:
# When starting an out of town site, don't actually use this craftsman - put it in
# reserve and return from the action. When the next craftsman comes up, attempt to
# start a site. In case this fails (no following craftsman action, no sites),
# we have to abort and roll it back.
# We need to be able to roll back actions to some extent anyway, since we want a 
# reasonable chance to undo misclicks and such.
# We can't stack up all craftsman actions ahead of time, since completing a building
# with one could affect how many craftsmen we get (eg. completing Ludus Magna).
# This makes it difficult to check if a craftsman action is coming up.
#
# Out-of-town site Option B:
# The caller must indicate that an out-of-town is allowed. While we can't stack
# up the craftsman actions, we can indicate that multiple in a row will follow if
# the first one is not used to complete or start a building.
# Here's a breakdown of all the possibilities for having extra craftsmen:
#
# 1) leading craftsman - check if we have craftsman client
# 2) clientele doubling via Circus Maximus - check if we've used the double for this
#    craftsman client, or if we have another client
# 3) performing craftsman client - check if we have another
# 4) peforming Amphitheater craftsman - check if we have at least 1 left after this one
# 5) Multiple lead/follow via Palace - check if we have another lead/follow 
# 6) performing last Amphitheater craftsman - check if we have a client.
#
#
# STATE:
#   1 which player to query
#   2 what info to get
#   3 what to do with that info (stack up game actions)
#   4 how to select the next state
#   5 hooks to tack actions onto this state
#
#   The possible next states can be manipulated by the player input and action 
#   (eg. the leader thinks and there is no option to follow, or a building 
#   is built whose action requires more input from players).
#
#   The hooks let us trigger on being in a specific game state (eg. academy lets
#   you think at the end of the turn)
#
#   Not sure if we need to be able to dynamically change the state objects, like
#   setting the destination state, etc. Ideally, the states are roughly
#   deterministic, looping through people's turns.
#
#
# Example:
#
# STATE(start_of_turn):
#   1 Query active player
#   2 Get action (think or role and cards to lead)
#   3 If lead, place card(s) in camp
#     If thinker, enqueue ACTION(thinker)
#   4 If think, -->STATE(end_turn)
#     If lead, -->STATE(player_follow)
#
#   Because we need to be able to trigger specifically on thinker actions,
#   perform_thinker is a separate action. In principle this could happen
#   to make different atoms. For instance, an ACTION for deciding to think or
#   lead, then states for picking the type of thinker and a state for picking
#   which role to lead. It's a fluid definition.
#
#
# List of all states and actions:
#
# STATE(start_of_turn) : gets lead or thinker from active player
# STATE(inactive_players_follow) : gets follow or thinker from inactive players
# STATE(role_action) : a player performing his follow/lead.
# STATE(end_turn) : enqueue kids_in_pool
#
# ACTION(lead_role)
# ACTION(perform_thinker)
# ACTION(client_action)
# ACTION(perform_laborer)
# ACTION(perform_craftsman)
# ACTION(perform_merchant)
# ACTION(perform_patron)
# ACTION(perform_legionnary)
# ACTION(perform_architect)
# ACTION(resolve_school) : enqueue a bunch of ACTION(perform_thinker)
# ACTION(resolve_<buildings>) : etc. for all buildings
# ACTION(kids_in_pool) : senate, sewer hooks into this

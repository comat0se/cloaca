MVCServer walkthrough - skipping game_state manipulation errors
=====================
server = MVCServer(game_state)

# Initializes to our game state, P1 starts.
server.run()
  --> server.take_turn(p1)

# Asks for think or lead
server.take_turn(p1)
  should_think = REQUEST(p1, think_or_lead) # p1: "LEAD"
  if should_think:
    --> server.perform_thinker_action(p1)
  else:
    role_being_led = --> server.lead_role_action(p1)
    leading_or_following_players = [p1]
    for player in non_active_players:
      should_think = REQUEST(player, think_or_follow) # p2: "follow"
      if should_think:
        --> server.perform_thinker_action(player)
      else:
        --> server.follow_role_action(player, role_being_led)
        leading_or_following_players.append(player)
    
    for player in leading_or_following_players:
      --> server.perform_role_being_led(player)

    --> server.end_turn()
    
server.lead_role_action(p1):
  cards_to_lead, role = REQUEST(p1, cards_to_lead) # p1: "Jack, Laborer"
  verify_legal_lead(p1, cards_to_lead, role)
  game_state.MoveCardsFromHandToCamp(p1, cards_to_lead)

server.follow_role_action(player, role_being_led):
